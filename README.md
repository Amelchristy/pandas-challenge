Heroes of Pymoli is a recent free-to-play Fantasy Game. In this repository, I would like to generate to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights. This project is written in Python.

My observations based on my report,
1. The male dominates the list of players who purchased additional items to enhance their playing experience.
2. The age range with most purchase count comes from the 20-24 age range. My thought is that most of them are either college students or recent graduates. However, <10 yrs old age group has higher average purchase price eventhough their count is very small. 
3. "Final Critic,"Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm," and "Nirvana" have the highest purchase count, putting them to the most popular item on the list.
